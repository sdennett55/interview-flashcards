A higher-order function is any function that takes one or more functions as arguments, which it uses to operate on some data, and/or returns a function as a result. Higher-order functions are meant to abstract some operation that is performed repeatedly. The classic example of this is `map`, which takes an array and a function as arguments. `map` then uses this function to transform each item in the array, returning a new array with the transformed data. Other popular examples in JavaScript are `forEach`, `filter`, and `reduce`. A higher-order function doesn't just need to be manipulating arrays as there are many use cases for returning a function from another function. `Function.prototype.bind` is one such example in JavaScript.
